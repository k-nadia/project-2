# **Introduction**
<br>
Portfolio Project 2 - Code Institute Full Stack Development Diploma
<br><br>
Type Library is an interactive front-end site which serves the purpose of helping users improve their typing speed (WPM) and accuracy, using a unique approach to learning.
<br><br>
Traditional online typing tests often rely on paragraphs consisting of randomly generated words which do not form sentences or hold any kind of meaning. This approach tests ones typing skills but can be a rather dull exercise for the user and does little to engage their mind with the actual content they are typing. 
<br><br>
The 'Type Library' application aims to solve this problem by incorporating excerpts from well-known classic and cult novels, to make type practice more engaging and enriching. 
<br><br>
Our approach transforms typing from an often monotonous practice into one that engages users with meaningful and beautifully written text, providing context and narrative that enhances their motivation and enjoyment. This approach not only helps improve typing speed and accuracy but also introduces users to valuable literature, potentially sparking interest in new books and authors. 
<br><br>
Typing excerpts from well-crafted prose can aid in developing a deeper understanding of language, rhythm, and structure, making the practice not just a test of skill but an opportunity for literary appreciation and learning.

## **DESIGN**

### **Colours**

### **Typography**

All fonts used throughout the application were sourced from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
<br>
- Used for: body
- I chose to use this serif font throughout the website because it closely resembles the typefaces commonly used in printed books, evoking a sense of nostalgia and authenticity that aligns perfectly with the literary theme of the platform. By incorporating Cormorant Garamond, users can enjoy an immersive typing experience that mirrors the feel of reading classic literature, helping to create a deeper connection to the text they are typing. Its readability and classic aesthetics not only enhance the visual appeal of the website but also honor the literary tradition, making it a fitting choice for a site dedicated to showcasing the beauty of classic prose.

## **UX / UI**

### **User Stories**

As a user:

- I want to choose the duration of the typing test (30 seconds, 1 minute, etc.) so that I can customize my experience based on my available time or focus level.

- I want the game to generate a random excerpt from a literary novel so that I can enjoy engaging content while practicing my typing skills.

- I want to receive my results immediately after completing the typing test to gain instant feedback on my performance and track my progress.

- I want to see my words per minute (WPM) score on the results page so that I can evaluate the speed of my typing.

- I want to see my accuracy percentage on the results page to understand how well I typed the provided excerpt without errors.

- I want to view the total number of words typed so that I can measure my productivity during the test.

- I want to know the total number of errors made so that I can identify areas for improvement in my typing skills.

- I want the ability to retry the test after viewing my results so that I can practice and improve my typing speed and accuracy.

- I want to see the book title and the author of the excerpt I typed so that I can discover new literature and potentially find my next read.


As a developer: 

- I want to access a README file so that I can understand the scope and purpose of the project and locate essential information regarding the website
- I want to access deployment information so I can follow step-by-step instructions on how to deploy the project
